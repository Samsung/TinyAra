		To test different application access, two application binaries
		should be flashed. This config makes using pre-built application binaries.
		Note! 1. Initial binaries are built with NXP imxrt1050-evk. To use this
		        with another board, pre-built binaries should be replaced.
		      2. ELF example makes application binaries itself so that
		         when it is enabled, this should be turned off.
