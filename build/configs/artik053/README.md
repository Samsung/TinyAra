## Information

The Samsung ARTIK™ 053 Module is a highly integrated module for secure Internet of Things (IoT) devices that require Wi-Fi®. It is based on an ARM® Cortex® R4 core with on-chip memories, a complete 2.4GHz Wi-Fi® Phy, MAC layer processing, a large complement of standard digital buses, a PUF-based security system and power management. The module is packaged with additional external Flash memory, a hardware Secure Element and a single integrated 2.4GHz structural antenna.
Aimed especially at power-sensitive devices needing Wi-Fi®, the ARTIK 053 Module provides excellent performance in a variety of environments, with a feature set tailored specifically for IoT end nodes.

Here is a [memory map](scripts/README.md).

## Environment Set-up
### On Chip Debugger installation

OpenOCD is used to program and debug.

OpenOCD v0.10.0 is recommended and can be installed like below,
but pre-built OpenOCD binaray on tools/openocd/linux64(or 32) can be used without installing.
```bash
sudo apt-get build-dep openocd
git clone --depth 1 -b v0.10.0 https://git.code.sf.net/p/openocd/code openocd-code
cd openocd-code
./bootstrap
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

### Add USB device Rules

This is an optional environment.  
But as ARTIK is connected through USB, some operation like programming of binary can't be worked without this configuration.

1. Make a file named 99-\<anyname\>.rules.
2. Add below contents at above file.
```
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb",ATTRS{idVendor}=="0403",ATTRS{idProduct}=="6010",MODE="0666" RUN+="/sbin/modprobe ftdi_sio" RUN+="/bin/sh -c 'echo 0403 6010 > /sys/bus/usb-serial/drivers/ftdi_sio/new_id'"
```
3. Place the above file in /etc/udev/rules.d folder with sudo permission.
4. Reboot your system.


## How to program a binary

There are two methods, using OpenOCD or script.

After building Tizen RT, follow below steps at $TIZENRT_BASEDIR/os folder.

TIZENRT_BASEDIR was set at [[Getting the sources]](../../../README.md#getting-the-sources) tab of Quick Start.

### Using download script

```bash
make download ALL
```
This makes complete set of binaries programmed.

### Using OpenOCD

This is used to program a partial binary.

Export 'OPENOCD_SCRIPTS' to environment variable.

```bash
export OPENOCD_SCRIPTS=$TIZENRT_BASEDIR/build/configs/artik053/tools/openocd
```

At first, programming the complete set of binaries are needed.

```bash
openocd -f artik053.cfg -c ' \
    flash_write bl1    ../build/configs/artik053/bin/bl1.bin;      \
    flash_write bl2    ../build/configs/artik053/bin/bl2.bin;      \
    flash_write sssfw  ../build/configs/artik053/bin/sssfw.bin;    \
    flash_write wlanfw ../build/configs/artik053/bin/wlanfw.bin;   \
    flash_write os     ../build/output/bin/tinyara_head.bin;       \
    exit'
```

Once the complete binaries are successfully programmed, each partition can be updated seperately with new one.
```bash
openocd -f artik053.cfg -c ' \
    flash_write os ../build/output/bin/tinyara_head.bin; exit'
```

## ROMFS

Before executing below steps, execute [generic steps](../../../tools/fs/README_ROMFS.md), step 1 and step 2.  
When you use artik053/iotivity config, you can execute only step 4. But note that if you want to resize the rom partition,  
you must modify partition_map.cfg matching the sizes in ARTIK053_FLASH_PART_LIST.

3. Modify partition configs  
    Below steps creates ROMFS partition with size 400KB at next of user partition.  
    1. Split user partition size from (1400) to (1000, 400) in ARTIK053_FLASH_PART_LIST
        ```bash
        Board Selection -> change values at Flash partition size list (in KBytes)
        ```
    2. Append "romfs" at next of *smartfs* to ARTIK053_FLASH_PART_TYPE
        ```bash
        Board Selection -> append string at Flash partition type list
        ```
    3. Append "rom" at next of *user* to ARTIK053_FLASH_PART_NAME
        ```bash
        Board Selection -> append string at FLash partition name list
        ```
4. Build Tizen RT  
5. Prepare ROM image
    ```bash
    sh $TIZENRT_BASEDIR/../tools/fs/mkromfsimg.sh
    ```
6. Modify partition map to *$TIZENRT_BASEDIR/../build/configs/artik053/tools/openocd/partition_map.cfg*
    ```bash
    user	{ "USER R/W"		0x04620000	0x000FA000  0 }
    rom  	{ "ROM FS"  		0x0471A000	0x00064000  0 }
    ```
7. Program a ROM image
    ```bash
    flash_write rom ../bin/romfs.img;    \
    ```
8. Mount on device
    ```bash
    mount -t romfs /dev/smart4rom9 /rom
    ```
