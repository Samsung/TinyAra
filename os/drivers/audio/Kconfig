config AUDIO_I2SCHAR
	bool "I2S character driver (for testing only)"
	default n
	depends on I2S && AUDIO
	---help---
		This selection enables a simple character driver that supports I2S
		transfers via a read() and write().  The intent of this driver is to
		support I2S testing.  It is not an audio driver but does conform to
		some of the buffer management heuristics of an audio driver.  It is
		not suitable for use in any real driver application in its current
		form.

config AUDIO_I2SCHAR_RXTIMEOUT
	int "RX timeout"
	default 0
	---help---
		This is a fixed timeout value that will be used for all receiver
		transfers.  This is in units of system clock ticks (configurable).
		The special value of zero disables RX timeouts.  Default: 0

config AUDIO_I2SCHAR_TXTIMEOUT
	int "TX timeout"
	default 0
	---help---
		This is a fixed timeout value that will be used for all transmitter
		transfers.  This is in units of system clock ticks (configurable).
		The special value of zero disables RX timeouts.  Default: 0

	---help---
		A do-nothinig audio device driver to simplify testing of audio

config AUDIO_ALC5658

        default n
        depends on AUDIO
        ---help---
                Select to enable support for the WM8904 Audio codec by Wolfson
                Microelectonics.  This chip is a lower level audio chip.. basically
                an exotic D-to-A.  It includes no built-in support for audio CODECS
                The ALC5658 provides:

                        - Low power consumption
                        - High SNR
                        - Stereo digital microphone input
                        - Digital Dynamic Range Controller (compressor / limiter)
                        - Digital sidetone mixing
                        - Ground-referenced headphone driver
                        - Ground-referenced line outputs

                NOTE: This driver also depends on both I2C and I2S support although
                that dependency is not explicit here.
